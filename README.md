# Ticket-Tracker

    This project is created using React, HTML, Scss and JavaScript

## About

    The Ticket Tracker is generating cards on the page based on the size of a team and inside the card is displaying the name of the person, the role, and a counter. 

    By clicking "+" or "-" the user can increase/decrease the number of tickets solved by that team member. The number of tickets cannot be decreased if the display number is zero.

    The counter is unique and the number of tickets can be changed individually for each member at a time.
